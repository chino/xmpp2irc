Synopsis:
	Chat on multiple irc servers/channels via a Jabber bot.

Why:
	I needed a way to access irc from gmail and my cell phone (which
	has a very reliable gtalk client).  Also could be used to run 
	commands on your remote machine.

Setup:
	Copy the *.template files to their basename and edit them.
	Then ./run.rb
