Chat on multiple irc servers/channels through a Jabber bot.

I needed a way to access irc from gmail/gtalk because irc access was blocked behind a firewall.

Together with gtalk client it's one of the most stable and friendly irc clients I've ever used on a mobile device:

* gtalk is available on almost every mobile os you'd care for
* server side connection prevents irc drops
* gtalk client will download missed messages once online
* gtalk client will send messages once internet connection returns
* custom shortcuts makes it very nice to type commands
* easy customizable using ruby
* run commands on your remote server (much more stable, faster, easier than connectbot)
